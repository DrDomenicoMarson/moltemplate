This directory contains an example of a couarse-grained (vaguely protein-like)
heteropolymer consisting of 14 residues, each of which has 2 particles
(one backbone bead, CA, one residue bead, R).
The "R" beads are attracted to each other.
There are 27 copies of this polymer in the simulation.


### Instructions 
Instructions on how to build LAMMPS input files and
run a short simulation are provided in other README files.

#### Step 1) README_setup.sh
This file explains how to use moltemplate.sh to build the files that
LAMMPS needs.

#### Step 2) README_run.sh
This file explains how to use LAMMPS to run a simulation using the
files you created in step 1.
