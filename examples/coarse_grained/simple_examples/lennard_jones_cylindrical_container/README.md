### Details

This example demonstrates how to build a simple system
containing mobile and immobile atoms using moltemplate.
An immobile tube is constructed of Lennard Jones particles (see "system.lt")
interacting with a fluid composed of (similar sized) Lennard Jones particles.

### Instructions 
Instructions on how to build LAMMPS input files and
run a short simulation are provided in other README files.

#### Step 1) README_setup.sh
This file explains how to use moltemplate.sh to build the files that
LAMMPS needs.

#### Step 2) README_run.sh
This file explains how to use LAMMPS to run a simulation using the
files you created in step 1.
