3bp2p DNA model
===============

### Warning: This is an unpublished DNA model

This DNA example was intended to be used in a publication.
We released these files to the public in order to accompany this publication,
but that publication was indefinitely delayed.  However this DNA model has been
[carefully parameterized](simple_dna_example/moltemplate_files/deriving_force_field_parameters)
and
[tested](simple_dna_example#features).

If you want to use this model that's fine.
If you feel like collaborating with us, that's great.
But since I released the files by mistake, you are not obligated to do that.
These files are impossible to retract.
I just don't want to surprise you later if we publish a paper with
this model later on.  (I'll post a link to it here when that happens.)
