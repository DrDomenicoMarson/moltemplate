## Description

*mol22lt.py* is a program for extracting information from MOL2 files
and converting the result into moltemplate (LT) file format.

The [MOL2 file format](https://zhanggroup.org/DockRMSD/mol2.pdf)
is a versatile file generated by many popular molecular simulation software
tools, (including AmberTools, Gaussian, OpenBabel, and the PyRed server).

This program will extract the following information from a MOL2 file:

- charge (column 9 of the ATOM section)
- atom-names (column 2 of the ATOM section)
- XYZ coordinates (columns 3,4,5 of the ATOM section)
- atom-type (column 6 of the ATOM section)
- subunit-id (column 7 of the ATOM section)
- subunit-name (column 8 of the ATOM section)
- bonds (columns 2 and 3 from the BOND section)

This program will *IGNORE* the following information in a MOL2 file:

- *any information* ***not*** *contained in the ATOM or BOND sections*
- atom id (column 1 from the ATOM section)
- bond id (column 1 from the BOND section)
- bond type (column 4 from the BOND section)
- "chain" (subunit/substructure ID numbers *are* considered, but not the "chain")
- status bits (columns 10 and 5 from the ATOM and BOND sections, respectively)


#### MOL2 file format requirements

- The *atom-names* (2nd column) must be unique
within each molecular subunit.  

- All of the atom-ID numbers and subunit-ID numbers
in the file must be unique and begin at 1
(although the order can vary).


### Force Fields

The atom type names (column 6 of the MOL2 file)
may correspond to atom types used by
popular force-fields (such as AMBER GAFF or GAFF2).
If you want to use these force fields in your simulations,
you must let moltemplate know the name of force field and the file
that stores the force field parameters using the *--ff* and *--ff-file*
arguments.  *(Example: "--ff GAFF2 --ff-file gaff2.lt")*


### Molecular Subunits

LT files are typically used to store (one or more) molecule type definitions
(or monomers or other types of molecular subunits).
The LT files generated by *mol22lt.py* contain definitions of all of the
molecules or molecular subunits (a.k.a. "substructures")
defined in the MOL2 file.
If the the MOL2 file contains multiple identical types of molecules
or molecular subunits, the resulting LT file will contain multiple
redundant definitions of the same molecular subunits.
This won't cause any problems (other than larger LT files).

If the user wants to avoid redefining the same types of molecules
(or molecular subunits), it is their responsibility to supply
a MOL2 file which does not contain multiple copies of the same subunit.
(Then they can use moltemplate's "new", ".move()", and ".rot()" commands
to instantiate multiple copies of the molecule instead of redefining it.)



## Arguments


### --in FILE.mol2

Specify the name of the MOL2 file you want to convert.
*(If omitted, the terminal (stdin) is used by default.)*


### --out FILE.lt

Specify the name of the moltemplate file (LT file) you want to create.
*(If omitted, the terminal (stdout) is used by default.)*


### --charges CHARGES.txt

**OPTINAL:**
If the the charges in the MOL2 file are not correct,
you can customize them by supplying a file containing
the correct charges using the *--charges* argument.
This is a one-column text file containing one number per line
*(Comments following '#' characters are allowed.)*
If omitted, the charges in the MOL2 file are used instead (if present).


### --name MOLECULE_NAME

By default *mol22lt.py* will treat each molecular subunit
(a.k.a. "substructure") in the MOL2 file as an independent molecule.
If there are bonds connecting them together, they will be included,
however each molecular subunit will have a different molecule name.
*(And the atoms in different subunits will be assigned to
  different molecule-ID numbers.)*
This is inconvenient to use.
Later you want to create multiple copies of this entire molecule (polymer), you
will have to copy each one of these molecular subunits that it is built from.

The *--name* argument allows you to group everything together in
a single molecule definition.  Later on, you can refer to this entire
compound molecule using the *MOLECULE_NAME* you gave it.
*(And all of the the atoms in the entire file will share the same molecule-ID.)*

This is useful if you plan to use this molecule as a building block for
creating larger simulations.

*Note:* There is no need to use the *--name* argument
if your MOL2 file only contains a single molecular subunit definition.
This argument was intended for use with more complex molecules
that contain multiple subunits, such as polymers.


### --ff FORCE_FIELD

**OPTINAL:**
If the molecules are associated with a particular force field (such as GAFF2),
the user should specify that using this argument (eg. "--f GAFF2").
The atom names in the MOL2 file will be used to lookup the force field
parameters from that force field.
*(You should probably also specify the name of the file containing
that force field using the --ff-file argument.)*

### --ff-file FORCE_FIELD_FILE

**OPTINAL:**
This will add a line to the beginning of the LT file generated by this program
telling moltemplate to load a file.
(Typically this file contains atom type definitions and force field parameters.)
In the example above, if you are using the GAFF2 force field, you would use
*"--ff-file gaff2.lt"*.  (The "gaff2.lt" stores the GAFF2 parameters.)


## Python API

It is possible to access the functionality of *mol22lt.py* from 
within python.  Example:

```python
import moltemplate
# Open the file you want to convert
fMol2 = open('FILE.mol2', 'r')
# Now create a new moltemplate file
fLT   = open('FILE.lt', 'w')
# Write the contents of the new file
ConvertMol22Lt(fMol2,
               fLT,
               ff_name = 'GAFF2',        # <-- optional argument
               ff_file = 'gaff2.lt',     # <-- optional argument
               object_name = 'Butane')   # <-- optional argument
```
